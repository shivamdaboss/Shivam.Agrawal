        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I programmed the robot with the help of one other teammate. We had a very specific file structure. In addition to the files opcontrol.c, auto.c, and init.c, the three source code files, we used a robot.c and a robot.h function. In robot.c and robot.h, we declared all of the basic variables and functions used by the robot. For example, we had a drive function, lift function, and variables for the buttons. The added functions and variables were to go into their own seperate files. In opcontrol.c, we only called functions. </br></p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the add-on files were for the lcd and were called lcd.c and lcd.h. In these files, all of the lcd functions and variables were declared and defined. For the lcd, we used a struct called slide to define the general features of a slide. We then made an array of the slide structs, and used a counter to cycle through them. In order to recieve values from the buttons, we checked if the button were pressed before but not currently. This allowed for us to do commands on release of the button. We also put a boolean in the slide struct called “pressed” and made it true when a slide was selected. This would allow the slides to stay on their respective screens after a slide was selected. Some of the slides on lcd include motor testing, battary voltage display as well as an auton recorder.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another set of files was the auton recorder file set, autonRecorder.c and autonRecorder.h. This file set included all of the declarations and defenitions for functions and variables related to the auton recorder. This program allowed the driver to drive the robot for a specific time based off of the mode selected and the robot would record it. Then the robot could play it back. This program has three steps essentially. The first step is to record. Based off the mode selected, the program will record the robots movements for however many milliseconds. There is a struct called robot with all of the movement values of the robots. Every millisecond, the values of the robot struct are updated and then recorded on a file. The next step is to save the file. There were ten slots that allowed for a 15 second run, and one slot for a 60 second run. The last step is to play it back. In this step, the robot simply reads the values off of the file, and updates the robot struct. Everytime the robot struct is updated, which is every millisecond, functions designed for the playback will take the robot struct values and use them so that the robot will act on them.

        <h2>Coding Pong</h2>

        <p>
          In my free time, I coded the simple game Pong in C++ for fun. I got some fun practice with classes and objects as well as game loops. I made the game using realistic physics, having a slow down period for each paddle after being moved. This was done by reducing the velocity over time based off of a constant, or the coefficient of friction.

        <h2>Teaching</h2>

        <p>
          I mentored a team of middle schoolers weekly with a fellow team member. I taught them the basics of coding in C/C++ as well as the file structure and functions in PROS, the IDE we use. I also gave them advice to mechanically strengthen their robot and helped build it. They ended up winning an award at a competition.

        <h2>Website</h2>

        <p>
          I learned HTML and CSS as well as some basic Javascript to code this website. I used jQuery and other libraries to get the animations to act on scroll and get the percentage circles. This really taught me a lot about web development and sparked an interest inside me to look more deeply into careers like front-end development.
